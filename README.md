# Windows Media Player Discord RPC
Hooks into running windows media player, and displays status on Discord.
Some code (the hook into WMP) borrowed from the [Last.FM Desktop Scrobbler 3.0](https://github.com/lastfm/lastfm-windows-desktop)


# Troubleshooting
If the Discord Rich Presence doesn't work, try changing the current playing music track in Windows Media Player to something else, while WMPDiscordRPC is opened and running.
